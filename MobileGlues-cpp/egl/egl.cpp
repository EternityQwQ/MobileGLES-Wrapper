// by. The fallback context in loader.cpp needs exactly that: a context bound to

// Window-surface redirection
//
// Why this exists, from the log:
//
//   306  eglCreateWindowSurface -> 0x77530f5980      (first window)
//   313  eglMakeCurrent         -> 0x77530f5980
//   324  SDL_Hook: reusing primary window 0x78638a0600, refs=2
//   326  eglMakeCurrent: released
//   327  eglDestroySurface      -> 0x77530f5980
//   338  eglCreateWindowSurface -> 0x77c7356e00      (second window)
//
// SDL caches the EGLSurface inside its own window (0x78638a0600, reused). Its
// cached copy is 0x77530f5980, which by line 338 is already destroyed. Anything
// SDL then does with that handle is an operation on a dead surface, so its swap
// cannot reach the screen — and indeed this library's eglSwapBuffers and both
// damage variants were called zero times in every session logged.
//
// The fix is to stop letting that handle die. Window surfaces are kept alive in
// a short history, and any operation that arrives on an older one is redirected
// to the newest. SDL keeps using its cached handle, we quietly serve the surface
// that is actually on screen, and the swap chain completes — after which the
// present fallback switches itself off and the rolling-back goes away, because
// the application is presenting at its own frame boundaries again.
//
// Only surfaces created by eglCreateWindowSurface / eglCreatePlatformWindowSurface
// are tracked. Pbuffers and pixmaps are destroyed immediately as before.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ===========================================================================
// Window surface — MobileGL's single-slot model
//
// MobileGL (MG_Backend/DirectGLES/DirectGLES.cpp) keeps exactly one of each:
//
//     g_Display, g_Config, g_Context, g_Surface
//
// and every operation goes through them:
//
//     InitWindowSurface(w)  DestroyEGLContext();              // old one dies first
//                           g_Surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(g_Display, g_Config, w, nullptr)
//                           MakeCurrent()                     // bound immediately
//     MakeCurrent()         eglMakeCurrent(g_Display, g_Surface, g_Surface, g_Context)
//     Present()             eglSwapBuffers(g_Display, g_Surface)
//     DestroyEGLContext()   eglMakeCurrent(NO_SURFACE,...); eglDestroyContext; eglDestroySurface
//
// Two properties follow, and both matter here:
//
//   1. The old surface is destroyed BEFORE the new one is created. On Android a
//      native window accepts only one EGLSurface, so any other order makes the
//      next eglCreateWindowSurface fail outright.
//   2. A stale handle still held by the caller cannot break the swap chain:
//      operations issued on it are translated onto the slot instead of being
//      forwarded as-is.
//
// This library is a pass-through rather than a backend, so it cannot ignore the
// application's argument the way MobileGL does. It keeps the same single slot
// and TRANSLATES whatever handle the application passes onto that slot. That is
// what lets SDL keep using a handle it cached before the surface was destroyed.
//
// Only handles from eglCreateWindowSurface / eglCreatePlatformWindowSurface are
// tracked. Pbuffers and pixmaps pass through untouched and are destroyed at once.

//
// There is no pacing here, and none is needed: an application-driven call
// arrives once per frame by construction. The library no longer presents on its
// own. Every attempt to do so had to guess where a frame ends — a fixed

// Recovery for a creation that failed because the previous surface was still

// changing. That is why SDL reusing a cached window is harmless there: the
// handle it kept is still one MobileGL knows about.
//
// Surfaces are passed through: the application gets the host's own EGLSurface
// pointer, exactly as before ownership was tried.
//
// Ownership used to mean minting a handle of our own for every surface and
// translating it back to the host surface on every call. It did not earn its
// keep: the translation that actually keeps a dead handle working is
// ResolveWindowSurface() above, which compares handle VALUES against the live
// surface and the stale list — that works on host pointers just as well, since
// RecordWindowSurface() records what the host returned. Minting added a map, a
// mutex and a lookup on every surface-taking call, and the only thing it gave
// beyond that was re-creating a surface whose host side was gone, which the
// main paths (make current, swap) never needed because they are redirected
// instead.
//
// So: create, record, hand back the host pointer. A destroyed surface's value is
// still remembered in g_stale_window_surfaces, and every operation issued on it
// is pointed at whatever is on screen now.

    // eglGetProcAddress: what this library hands back
    //
    // It used to forward everything to glXGetProcAddress, which is a bare
    // dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, name). RTLD_DEFAULT searches only the GLOBAL symbol
    // scope, and a launcher that loads this library with dlopen(path,
    // RTLD_LOCAL) — the default — puts none of its symbols there. The lookup
    // then falls through to the host driver's libEGL.so and hands the
    // application the HOST's function, so that call bypasses this library
    // completely: no log, no tracking, no wrapper.
    //
    // The measurement says exactly that is happening. A session logged 297k
    // guarded GL calls in 20 seconds at roughly 878 draws per second — the
    // render loop running flat out — while eglSwapBuffers was never called
    // once. Whatever the application uses to present is not reaching this
    // library, and eglGetProcAddress is the only place it could have obtained
    // such a pointer.
    //
    // MobileGL gets this right by construction: GetProcAddress.cpp answers
    // through an explicit GETPROC table of its own entry points. This is the
    // same fix.
    //
    // Answering for our own entry points first is also just correct: a library
    // that intercepts EGL must hand out the interception, not the thing it
    // wraps, or the interception only works for callers that link directly.
