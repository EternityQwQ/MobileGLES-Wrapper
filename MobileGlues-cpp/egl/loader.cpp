// Fallback contexts
//
// A host driver discards every GL call made from a thread with no current EGL
// context: no object is created, no error is raised, queries simply return 0 or
// NULL. That produced the NULL glGetString, the zeroed glGetIntegerv, the NULL
// glMapBufferRange and the zero maxAnisotropy seen earlier in this session.
//
// Which context to hand a context-less thread is the whole difficulty, and four
// designs were tried on this device before this one:
//
//   1. One shared pbuffer context, bound and released around every call. Two
//      eglMakeCurrent round-trips per GL entry point corrupts state on
//      Adreno/turnip: 15 glMapBufferRange failures on buffers that had storage,
//      a glBufferStorage rejection, 14 texture uploads with nothing bound, and
//      a vertex shader that failed to compile with an empty info log.
//
//   2. One shared pbuffer context, bound and kept. An EGLContext may be current
//      on only one thread, so the render thread holding it across
//      CompletableFuture.join() starved the background executor's shader
//      compile. The game hung.
//
//   3. One pbuffer context per thread, bound and kept. No contention, but a
//      pbuffer is a render target that is not connected to the display — every
//      draw succeeded and nothing was ever visible, while eglSwapBuffers
//      presented a window surface nothing had been drawn into. Black screen.
//
//   4. Bind the application's own context to its own window surface. Right idea
//      for the render thread, fatal everywhere else: the application's context
//      is one object, so the first context-less thread takes it and every
//      other thread is refused with EGL_BAD_ACCESS. Worse, the fallout is
//      silent — a thread that ends up with no context at all still "succeeds"
//      at every GL call.
//
// This one gives each thread a context of its own, so nothing is contended and
// nothing can deadlock, and creates it sharing with the application's context,
// so every object it makes is visible to the game. It binds with NO SURFACE:
// surfaceless contexts are supported here (config/gpu_utils.cpp has used one
// all session — "Adreno (TM) 619" was queried on one), and a surface is what
// made design 3 draw into something invisible. No pbuffer is created anywhere.
//
// The trade is that these contexts cannot present, which is fine: the thread
// that draws is the one already holding the application's context on the
// application's window surface, and that thread is left completely alone.

// Bind a context to a freshly created window surface, right away, on whichever

//
// This is the MobileGL/DirectGLES model: DirectGLES::InitWindowSurface()
// (MG_Backend/DirectGLES/DirectGLES.cpp) creates a window surface and then
// immediately calls its own MakeCurrent() with its OWN global g_Context —
// g_Surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(...); if (!MakeCurrent()) return false;
// It does NOT wait for the application to make a context current first.
// Therefore SDL reusing the primary window (creating a second surface before
// the application has bound its context to this thread) cannot leave the
// surface unbound. Measured on real hardware: without this, the second
// surface was created but never bound, and the screen stayed black while
// audio and buttons worked normally.
//
// There are two cases, and they are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE — case 1 returns on
// success and must never be followed by case 2 (see the note at the return).
//
// 1. The application already has a context bound somewhere (t.have_binding).
//    Use it — but only if it is not current on another thread. A context
//    current on another thread is left alone: EGL allows a context to be
//    current on one thread at a time, and stealing it would break the thread
//    that already has it.
//
// 2. No application context is bound yet (the SDL-reuse-window case), or the
//    application's context refused the surface. Fall back to this library's
//    own startup context (eglContext, created in init_target_egl()). This is
//    the key difference from the original version, which simply returned here
//    and left the surface orphaned. Binding our own context makes the surface
//    a valid, current drawable so the game's GL calls have somewhere to land;
